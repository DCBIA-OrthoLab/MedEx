# MedEx

`MedEx` is a repository dedicated to implementing Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract temporomandibular joint (TMJ)-related comorbidities from unstructured clinical text. It generates an automated, structured summary for each patient and provides an interactive visual dashboard to explore cohort-level statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and comorbidity frequency. This supports both clinical research and decision-making.
